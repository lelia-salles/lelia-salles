- 👋 Hi, I’m @lelia-salles 
- 👀 I’m a musician (recorder player and composer) and fullstack webdeveloper interested in the relation between music expression and technology
- 🌱 I have started my IT aprehenticeship in 2021 with Java, JS, Node.js, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, SASS, Devops (Python for security, AWS, Docker), Agile Methodology, Design Thinking, QA (Seleninum, Robots), UX/UI, SQL, NoSQL (MongoDB), Microservices with spring boot. Currently I am digging into Python, AWS, IA and BI
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of project. However, I look forward to meet musicians around here. I also founded [Master Musica](https://www.mastermusica.com.br), which is a startup for musicians.
- 📫 You can contact me at lelia@mastermusica.com.br or through [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leliasalles). I use to have another github account which I lost access and you can have a look at [here](https://www.github.com/leliasalles) in case you are interested
- 😄 Pronouns: Ms. Lelia Salles
- ⚡ Fun fact: no fun fact ...
- ✨ Somtimes I use a library PC for coding and as I have no admin access I can´t use SSH so I have created another branch named Telecentro@CDI-05
